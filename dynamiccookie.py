# we can delete explicit references on classes
del A
del B
 
# but the object still have implicit
# reference and the methods are still available
print(b.square()) # 100
 
# but, to change the class on some of build-in
# is impossible (in current version) and this is the
# feature of implementation
b.__class__ = dict # error
